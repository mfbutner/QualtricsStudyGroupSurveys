# Python Development Tools Comparison Guide

This guide compares Python development tools across different categories, focusing on their strengths, trade-offs, and use cases.

## Installation in externally managed Environments

When working with os such as ubuntu, macos, you'll encounter the "externally managed environment" error with pip. Use `pipx` instead of `pip` for installing development tools globally. See [this Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75608323/how-do-i-solve-error-externally-managed-environment-every-time-i-use-pip-3) for details.

- Modular architecture
- Good balance of features and performance
- Wide industry adoption

**Trade-offs:** Slower than Ruff, requires plugins for full functionality

**Best for:** Established projects with specific linting needs

### Pylint
**Documentation:** [https://pylint.readthedocs.io/](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/)

**Strengths:**
- Most comprehensive code analysis
- Detailed reports and metrics
- Extensive configuration options
- Code quality scoring

**Trade-offs:** Can be slow and overly verbose, steep learning curve
